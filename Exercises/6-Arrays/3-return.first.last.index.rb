  #3 How do you get the following code to return the word example? 

  arr = [["test", "hello", "world"],["example", "mem"]]
  arr.last.first 

  # => "example" 
  # => the methods above are strung together, the .last tells computer to shift focus to 2nd internal array
  # the .first following the .last, tells the computer to shift focus to the 1st index of 2nd internal array
