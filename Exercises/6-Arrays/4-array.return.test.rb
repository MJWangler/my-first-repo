  arr = [15, 7, 18, 5, 12, 8, 5, 1]
  
  arr.index(5)
  # => 3 - this scans the array and returns the index position that first presents a 5 

  arr.index[5] 
  # => this returns an error message because the syntax to attempt the previous example is incorrect

  arr[5] 
  #=> 8 - this returns the value in the 5th index position (6th sequential position)
