  #My Ruby verison is 2.5.5, so these answers are relative to Ruby 2.5.0 

  #1 The most complete documentation can be found here: https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/ 

  #2 The location for a description of while loop in Ruby: https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.5.0/syntax/control_expressions_rdoc.html#label-while+Loop 

  # - a = 0

    #while a < 10 do
      #p a
        #a += 1
      #end

      #p a 

  #3 The while loop will return "nil" with the exception of 'break', break will return a supplied value 

  #4 "Break accepts a value that supplies the result of the expression it is “breaking” out of" 
  
    #For example, result = [1, 2, 3].each do |value|
      #break value * 2 if value.even?
    #end

    #p result # prints 4

  #5 We can write big numbers using a concept called 'literals' 

    #Large numbers can be written in scientific notation much the same way a calculator does 
    #1.2E6 = 1200000 

  #6 Writing symbols was something taught to me in orientation, they are used when you want to reference a variable/string without initializing/changing

  #7 Class documentation for string classes can be found here: https://docs.ruby-lang.org/en/2.5.0/extension_rdoc.html#label-String+Functions 

  #8 #rjust method can be used to justify a string. Specially, rjust(*args).
